# Megaton Roto: Current Implementation Analysis

## 1. Current Architecture

### 1.1 Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python) with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with refresh tokens
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for videos, thumbnails, masks, and JPG sequences
- **Processing**: Custom video processing pipeline with SAM2 for rotoscoping
- **Compute**: GPU-accelerated inference for mask generation using PyTorch
- **Payment**: Stripe integration for subscription and credits
- **Deployment**: Microservice architecture with systemd services

### 1.2 Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js with React 
- **State Management**: Zustand for global state, Context API for auth/credits
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Media Handling**: Custom video player with frame-by-frame controls
- **UI Components**: Custom components for annotation, masking, and playback

### 1.3 Core Workflow
1. Users upload videos, which are transcoded and stored in S3
2. Users annotate videos with bounding boxes and positive/negative points
3. The system processes videos using SAM2 to generate masks
4. Processed masks and greenscreen videos are made available for download
5. Users are charged credits based on duration and processing options

### 1.4 Business Model
- Credit-based system for processing videos
- Tiered membership plans (Free, Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- Stripe integration for subscriptions and one-time credit purchases
- Admin controls for managing users and credits

## 2. Strengths and Limitations

### 2.1 Strengths
- **AI Technology**: Integration of state-of-the-art SAM2 model for high-quality masks
- **Optimized Processing**: Custom inference manager with batch processing and caching
- **Credit System**: Granular, flexible approach to monetization
- **S3 Integration**: Scalable storage solution with presigned URLs
- **User Experience**: Modern frontend with real-time annotation
- **Membership Tiers**: Flexible business model that can scale

### 2.2 Limitations
- **Processing Speed**: Heavy GPU computation for mask generation creates bottlenecks
- **Error Handling**: Incomplete error handling in some processing paths
- **Memory Management**: Potential memory leaks during large video processing
- **Scalability**: Current design points to a single instance for processing
- **Deployment**: Service configuration suggests a single-server architecture
- **Frontend Complexity**: Video annotation component has high complexity
- **Backend Organization**: Some code duplication and lack of modularization

## 3. Key Bottlenecks and Scalability Issues

### 3.1 Inference Processing
- **GPU Memory**: Current design loads entire videos into memory
- **Sequential Processing**: Tasks are processed in-sequence on a single machine
- **Lack of Queue Management**: No robust job queue system for distributed processing
- **Batch Size Limitations**: Hard-coded batch sizes based on resolution

### 3.2 Storage Management
- **S3 Organization**: Simple object structure without optimization for access patterns
- **Temporary Files**: Heavy reliance on local temporary storage for processing
- **URL Expiration**: Presigned URLs expire after 1 hour, requiring refresh

### 3.3 Database Load
- **Polling**: Task status polling creates unnecessary database load
- **Session Management**: Database session cleanup may be inconsistent
- **Transaction Isolation**: Lack of explicit transaction boundaries

### 3.4 Frontend Performance
- **Large Component State**: Complex state management in annotation components
- **Canvas Redrawing**: Inefficient redrawing of canvas elements
- **Video Processing**: All video processing happens client-side before upload

## 4. Technical Debt and Maintenance Challenges

### 4.1 Code Organization
- **Monolithic Structure**: Backend combines API, processing, and business logic
- **Long Functions**: Several functions exceed reasonable complexity
- **Debug Code**: Numerous debug print statements throughout the codebase
- **Commented Code**: Old, commented-out code sections in several files
- **Duplicate Logic**: Repeated code for S3 interactions and video processing

### 4.2 Error Handling
- **Inconsistent Patterns**: Mix of try/except with return values and exception propagation
- **Missing Recovery**: Limited automatic recovery from processing failures
- **Error Messages**: Inconsistent user-facing error messages

### 4.3 Configuration Management
- **Hard-coded Values**: Several hard-coded paths and values throughout the code
- **Environment Variables**: Inconsistent use of environment variables vs. settings
- **Secrets Management**: Potential security issues with AWS credentials handling

### 4.4 Testing
- **Limited Testing**: Minimal automated tests for core functionality
- **Manual Testing**: Heavy reliance on debug code suggests manual testing
- **No CI/CD**: No evidence of continuous integration or deployment

## 5. Production Readiness Assessment

### 5.1 Infrastructure Readiness
- **Single-Server Architecture**: Current setup appears limited to a single server
- **Service Configuration**: systemd services but no containerization or orchestration
- **Monitoring**: No visible monitoring or alerting infrastructure
- **Scaling Strategy**: No clear strategy for horizontal scaling

### 5.2 Reliability Issues
- **Error Recovery**: Limited ability to recover from failures during processing
- **Resource Management**: Potential for resource exhaustion (memory, disk)
- **Dependency Management**: No explicit versioning or dependency isolation

### 5.3 Security Considerations
- **JWT Implementation**: Solid refresh token implementation, but limited session controls
- **File Validation**: Basic file type and size validation, but could be enhanced
- **Permission Model**: Simple user/admin model with limited granularity

### 5.4 Performance
- **Optimizations**: Some optimizations for GPU utilization, but room for improvement
- **Resource Management**: Manual GC calls suggest memory management issues
- **Concurrent Users**: Untested for concurrent user loads

## 6. Recommendations for Scaling to Production

- Containerize services with Docker for easier deployment
- Implement Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Refactor frontend for better code organization and performance

### 6.3 Scalability Enhancements
